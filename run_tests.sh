# Runs the suite and saves a full, human-readable copy of everything that
# printed to the terminal -- pytest's own PASSED/FAILED/XFAILED summary
# plus every test's verbose wire-level diagnostics (bridge.py's -s output)
# -- to test_report.txt in this directory, in addition to showing it live.

# Deliberately a tee to a real pytest run rather than reconstructing a
# report from pytest's internal hooks: this project's tests are meant to
# be watched live (see pytest.ini's -s and bridge.py's VERBOSE flag), and
# a tee guarantees the saved report is byte-for-byte the same thing a
# human watched, with no risk of a hook-based reconstruction silently
# dropping or reordering output relative to what was actually shown.
#
# set -o pipefail matters here specifically: without it, this script's
# own exit code would always be tee's (0), silently hiding a real test
# failure from anything (CI, another script) checking $? after this runs.

# destination is a second, independent copy with ANSI color codes
# stripped (pytest.ini forces --color=yes, which is right for a live
# terminal but leaves escape-code noise in a plain-text file) before
# it's written to test_report.txt.
